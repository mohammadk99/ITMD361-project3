  <p>Linux is an operating system thats open source and free, which means the code is freely available and there is no cost to using it. Many use it for privacy, security, and freedom</p>
  <p>Linux is better for privacy, as it does not spy on you or report telemetry. The security of Linux is thought to be superior to other operating systems as it is less used, and therefore is not a target</p>
  <p>Linux is highly customizable, and gives you more freedom to do what you want with it, unlike other desktop OS</p>
